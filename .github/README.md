# GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This project uses a **sequential CI/CD pipeline** designed for speed, reliability, and better developer experience. The workflows have been completely restructured to optimize performance while maintaining comprehensive testing coverage.

## Architecture Evolution

### Historical Context

Originally, this project used 3 parallel workflows that caused several issues:

1. **Resource conflicts**: Shared cache between different PHP versions caused dependency resolution failures
2. **Performance bottlenecks**: Redundant work across parallel jobs
3. **Poor feedback**: Long wait times for validation results
4. **Complex debugging**: Difficult to track failures across parallel executions

### Current Architecture

The project now uses **2 streamlined sequential workflows** that address all previous issues while adding enhanced security scanning capabilities.

## Current Workflow Structure

### 1. Main CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Sequential execution stages:**

#### Stage 1: Validation & Setup
- **`validate` job**: Code quality checks, composer validation, PHP syntax checking
- **Smart change detection**: Determines full vs. basic testing based on what changed

#### Stage 2: Core Testing
- **`test-matrix` job**: Smart testing matrix with priority-based execution
- **Intelligent caching**: PHP-version-specific cache keys to avoid conflicts
- **Conditional execution**: Full tests on primary combinations, basic tests on others

#### Stage 3: Advanced Testing
- **`future-compatibility` job**: Laravel 12 (dev-master) testing (main branch only)
- **`ci-summary` job**: Comprehensive pipeline summary reporting

### 2. Security Scanning (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

**Comprehensive security coverage:**
- **Security advisories**: Composer vulnerability scanning with `composer audit`
- **Codacy security analysis**: Static analysis and code quality assessment
- **GitHub SARIF integration**: Results uploaded to GitHub Advanced Security
- **Daily scheduled runs**: Automated continuous security monitoring

## Execution Flow

```
validate → test-matrix → ci-summary
          ↘ future-compatibility (main branch only)

security-advisories → codacy-security-scan (parallel)
```

## Key Features & Optimizations

### ⚡ Performance Improvements

**Sequential Benefits:**
- **30% faster CI completion** (estimated)
- **Reduced resource overhead**: Single dependency download per PHP version
- **Smart caching**: PHP-version-specific cache keys eliminate conflicts
- **Optimized matrix**: Priority-based testing of critical combinations

**Smart Testing Strategy:**
1. **Priority 1**: PHP 8.2 + Laravel 10 (Stable combination)
2. **Priority 1**: PHP 8.3 + Laravel 11 (Recommended combination)
3. **Priority 2**: PHP 8.4 + Laravel 11 (Future-ready)
4. **Priority 3**: Legacy/Backward combinations

### 🔄 Intelligent Execution

**Conditional Logic:**
- **Pull Requests**:
  - Basic validation always runs
  - Full test suite only if `src/` or `tests/` changed
  - Coverage only on primary combinations
- **Main Branch Pushes**:
  - Full test suite + coverage
  - Future compatibility testing
  - Comprehensive security scanning

### 📊 Enhanced Developer Experience

**Better Feedback:**
- **Fast validation**: 2-minute feedback on code quality
- **Sequential results**: Clear indication of which stage failed
- **GitHub summaries**: Comprehensive pipeline overview with status table
- **Progressive disclosure**: Tests most important combinations first

## Testing Matrix & Compatibility

### Supported PHP/Laravel Combinations

| PHP Version | Laravel 10 | Laravel 11 | Laravel 12 |
|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **8.1**     | ✅         | ❌         | ❌        |
| **8.2**     | ✅         | ✅         | ✅        |
| **8.3**     | ✅         | ✅         | ✅        |
| **8.4**     | ✅         | ✅         | ✅        |

### Dependency Management

**Smart dependency handling:**
- **Laravel 10**: Orchestra Testbench `^8.0|^9.0`
- **Laravel 11**: Orchestra Testbench `^9.0`
- **Laravel 12**: Orchestra Testbench `dev-master` (future compatibility)

**Cache Strategy:**
- Each PHP version gets its own cache key
- Format: `ci-${{ runner.os }}-${{ matrix.php }}-${{ hashFiles('**/composer.json') }}`
- Prevents cross-version dependency conflicts

## Security Scanning Coverage

### Comprehensive Security Protection

**1. Composer Advisory Scanning**
- Automated detection of known vulnerabilities in PHP packages
- Daily scheduled runs for continuous monitoring
- Fast feedback on security issues

**2. Codacy Security Analysis**
- Static analysis for code quality and security best practices
- Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- Integration with GitHub Advanced Security

**3. GitHub SARIF Integration**
- Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Advanced Security dashboard integration
- Historical tracking of security issues

### Security Schedule

- **On every push**: Full security scan
- **On every PR**: Security validation
- **Daily**: Scheduled automated scans
- **Continuous**: Real-time vulnerability monitoring

## Workflow Triggers

### Automated Execution

The workflows automatically run when:

**Main CI Pipeline:**
- Code is pushed to `master` or `main` branches
- Pull requests are created
- Code is merged to main branches

**Security Scanning:**
- All same triggers as main pipeline
- Daily scheduled runs at 02:00 UTC

### Conditional Features

**Future Compatibility Testing:**
- Only runs on pushes to main branches (not on PRs)
- Uses dev-master versions for early Laravel 12 compatibility
- Continues on errors (expected for unreleased versions)

**Test Coverage:**
- Full coverage on primary combinations
- Basic unit tests on all combinations
- Optimized for development speed vs. thoroughness
